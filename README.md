SimPar : A macro language for introducing parallel concepts to CS1 students

Simpar works very much like OpenMP except that it simplifies some of the more _complex_
directives. It is not meant to be a practical API for parallel programming. It's main goal is to
create working examples of parallel code for CS1 students with no background in parallel
programming. 

SimPar is essentially a source-to-source transformer. It takes as input an annotated C/C++ source
and converts it to OpenMP.
